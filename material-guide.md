## PLA <a name = "pla"></a>

PLA, or Polylactic Acid is one of the most popular materials used in FDM 3D printing. It is a fantastic material to learn with as it is easy to print, inexpensive and produces good quality parts. PLA is also the most environmentally friendly plastic available to 3D print as it is derived from crops such as sugar cane.

- Extruder Temperature: 190-220 °C
- Bed Temperature: 45-60 °C
- Heated Bed: Optional
- Glass Transition Temperature: 65 °C
- Density: 1.24 g/cm<sup>3</sup>
- Coefficient of Thermal Expansion: 68 µm/m-°C
- Elastic (Young's, Tensile) Modulus: 3.5 GPa

## ABS <a name = "abs"></a>

Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, known as ABS for short, is a very popular 3D printing material due to its low-cost and good mechanical properties. It is a very tough and impact resistant material enabling durable 3D printed parts which can withstand high usage and wear. With a high glass transition temperature ABS can handle higher temperatures than many other printable materials before it begins to deform. When printing with this material ensure there is sufficient ventilation as the material has a slight odour and can be harmful. Additionally, ABS contracts a lot as it cools down, so a heated bed is required if not a heated chamber to ensure minimal warping and shrinkage.

- Extruder Temperature: 220-250 °C
- Bed Temperature: 90-110 °C
- Heated Bed: Required
- Glass Transition Temperature: 105 °C
- Density: 1.04 g/cm<sup>3</sup>
- Coefficient of Thermal Expansion: 90 µm/m-°C
- Elastic (Young's, Tensile) Modulus: 1.4-3.1 GPa

## PETG <a name = "petg"></a>

PETG is a durable copolyester (a combination). Polyethylene terephthalate, commonly abbreviated PET is commonly used in fibres for clothing and containers for liquids and foods. The G means it’s been glycol modified for extra durability. It is a tough material which prints without odour and has similar print quality as PLA. The material has a low shrinkage and as such little to no warping making it ideal for larger prints. It has superb layer adhesion, resulting in strong prints - note that this makes PETG a poor support material. Another benefit of PETG is that it has excellent chemical resistance, along with alkali, acid and water resistance.

- Extruder Temperature: 230-250 °C
- Bed Temperature: 75-95
- Heated Bed: Required
- Glass Transition Temperature: 75 °C
- Density: 1.27 g/cm<sup>3</sup>
- Coefficient of Thermal Expansion: 60 µm/m-°C
- Elastic (Young's, Tensile) Modulus: 2.0-2.1 GPa

## Nylon <a name = "nylon"></a>

Nylon is an incredibly strong, durable and versatile 3D printing material. It is flexible when thin, and has very high inter-layer adhesion enabling the creation of strong and functional parts. It has a low coefficient of friction and high melting temperature making it an excellent choice for a variety of everyday items such as 3D printed tools, gears, RC cars and more. Nylon filament is incredibly hygroscopic, meaning that it readily absorbs water from the air, and should be kept in a very dry environment and preferably dried before printing.

- Extruder Temperature: 225-265 °C
- Bed Temperature: 70-90 °C
- Heated Bed: Required
- Glass Transition Temperature: 70 °C
- Density: 1.15 g/cm<sup>3</sup>
- Coefficient of Thermal Expansion: 95 µm/m-°C
- Elastic (Young's, Tensile) Modulus: 2.7 GPa

## TPU <a name = "tpu"></a>

TPU, or Thermoplastic Polyurethane is a common elastomer (elastic polymer) which can be printed on an FDM machine. In order to print high quality parts reliably a direct drive extruder is definitely recommended. The longer the distance from the extruder to the hotend the less the control as the filament acts like a spring. However, with enough calibration good prints can be achieved on a Bowden extruder. TPU requires a slow print speed of around 30mm/sec due to the fact that it is difficult to push the filament through the extruder thanks to its elastic nature. The material does not produce any noticeable fumes while printing and is a non-soluble material. It is however hygroscopic, which means it will degrade in wet conditions and also not food safe.

- Extruder Temperature: 210-240 °C
- Bed Temperature: 20–60 °C (not required)
- Heated Bed: Optional
- Density: 1.20g/cm<sup>3</sup>
- Coefficient of Thermal Expansion: 90µm/m-°C
- Elastic (Young's, Tensile) Modulus: _TPU almost doesn’t have any linear behavior, hence there is no statement on its Young’s modulus._

## HIPS <a name = "hips"></a>

High impact polystyrene, or HIPS, is a material blend of polystyrene and rubber. It can be dissolved in a limonene solution as such is used for support material, eliminating the need for removal via abrasives, cutting tools, or other methods that leave artefacts on your print. HIPS is similar to ABS, and is actually a little stronger. As such, apart from being used as a support material, it is also a good primary building material. HIPS is easily painted, machineable, and works with a large number of adhesives. It’s also food safe, non-toxic, fully recyclable, and non-hydroscopic, meaning it won’t degrade in humid environments. Unfortunately, HIPS gives off fumes while printing, just like ABS. HIPS will release small amounts of styrene into the atmosphere. Therefore, you should have your printer in a well-ventilated area while utilizing this material.

- Extruder Temperature: 230-245 °C
- Bed Temperature: 95-115 °C
- Heated Bed: Required
- Glass Transition Temperature: 100 °C
- Density: 1.08 g/cm<sup>3</sup>
- Coefficient of Thermal Expansion: 80 µm/m-°C
- Elastic (Young's, Tensile) Modulus: 1.9 GPa

## PVA <a name = "pva"></a>

PVA, or Polyvinyl Alcohol, is a soft and biodegradable 3D printable polymer that will dissolve when exposed to water, making it a very useful support structure material. PVA enables the printing of highly complex geometries as the supports used to create such shapes can be removed easily by dissolving in warm water.

- Extruder Temperature: 180-200 °C
- Bed Temperature: 45-60 °C
- Heated Bed: Required
- Glass Transition Temperature: 80 °C
