## PLA <a name = "pla"></a>

PLA, or Polylactic Acid is one of the most popular materials used in FDM 3D printing. It is a fantastic material to learn with as it is easy to print, inexpensive and produces good quality parts. PLA is also the most environmentally friendly plastic available to 3D print as it is derived from crops such as sugar cane.

- Extruder Temperature: 190-220 °C
- Bed Temperature: 45-60 °C
- Glass Transition Temperature: 65 °C
- Density: 1.24g/cm<sup>3</sup>

## ABS <a name = "abs"></a>

Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, known as ABS for short, is a very popular 3D printing material due to its low-cost and good mechanical properties. It is a very tough and impact resistant material enabling durable 3D printed parts which can withstand high usage and wear. With a high glass transition temperature ABS can handle higher temperatures than many other printable materials before it begins to deform. When printing with this material ensure there is sufficient ventilation as the material has a slight odour and can be harmful. Additionally, ABS contracts a lot as it cools down, so a heated bed is required if not a heated chamber to ensure minimal warping and shrinkage.

- Extruder Temperature: 220-250 °C
- Bed Temperature: 90-110 °C
- Glass Transition Temperature: 105 °C
- Density: 1.04g/cm<sup>3</sup>

## PETG <a name = "petg"></a>

PETG is a durable copolyester (a combination). Polyethylene terephthalate, commonly abbreviated PET is commonly used in fibres for clothing and containers for liquids and foods. The G means it’s been glycol modified for extra durability. It is a tough material which prints without odour and has similar print quality as PLA. The material has a low shrinkage and as such little to no warping making it ideal for larger prints. It has superb layer adhesion, resulting in strong prints - note that this makes PETG a poor support material. Another benefit of PETG is that it has excellent chemical resistance, along with alkali, acid and water resistance.

- Extruder Temperature: 230-250 °C
- Bed Temperature: 75-95 °C
- Glass Transition Temperature: 75 °C
- Density: 1.27g/cm<sup>3</sup>

## Nylon <a name = "nylon"></a>

- Extruder Temperature: 225-265 °C
- Bed Temperature: 70-90 °C
- Glass Transition Temperature: 70 °C
- Density: 1.15g/cm<sup>3</sup>

## TPU <a name = "tpu"></a>

TPU, or Thermoplastic Polyurethane is a common elastomer (elastic polymer) which can be printed on an FDM machine. In order to print high quality parts reliably a direct drive extruder is definitely recommended. The longer the distance from the extruder to the hotend the less the control as the filament acts like a spring. However, with enough calibration good prints can be achieved on a Bowden extruder. TPU requires a slow print speed of around 30mm/sec due to the fact that it is difficult to push the filament through the extruder thanks to its elastic nature. The material does not produce any noticeable fumes while printing and is a non-soluble material. It is however hygroscopic, which means it will degrade in wet conditions and also not food safe.

- Extruder Temperature: 210-240 °C
- Bed Temperature: 20–60 °C (not required)
- Density: 1.20g/cm<sup>3</sup>

## HIPS <a name = "hips"></a>

- Extruder Temperature: 230-245 °C
- Bed Temperature: 95-115 °C
- Glass Transition Temperature: 100 °C
- Density: 1.08g/cm<sup>3</sup>

## PVA <a name = "pva"></a>

- Extruder Temperature: 180-200 °C
- Bed Temperature: 45-60 °C
- Glass Transition Temperature: 80 °C
- Density: 1.19g/cm<sup>3</sup>
